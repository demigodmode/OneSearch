## AGPL vs GPL

The AGPL is similar to the GPL, with one important difference:

**GPL**: Only requires source code disclosure if you distribute the software.

**AGPL**: Requires source code disclosure if you deploy the software as a network service.

This ensures OneSearch remains open source even when used as a hosted service.

---

## Why AGPL

We chose AGPL-3.0 to ensure:

**OneSearch stays open source** - Even if someone deploys a modified version as a service, they must share their changes.

**Community benefits** - Improvements made by anyone benefit everyone.

**Freedom preserved** - Users can always access, modify, and run the code.

## Dependencies

All OneSearch dependencies use permissive licenses compatible with AGPL-3.0:

## Commercial Use

Yes, you can use OneSearch commercially. The AGPL doesn't restrict commercial use.

However, if you modify OneSearch and deploy it as a service (e.g., offering search-as-a-service to customers), you must:

1. Provide the source code to your users
2. License your modifications under AGPL-3.0
3. Include installation instructions
