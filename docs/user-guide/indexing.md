How OneSearch indexes your files.

!!! note "Coming Soon"
    Detailed indexing documentation coming soon.

## Key Concepts

- **Incremental Indexing** - Only changed files are reindexed
- **Full Reindex** - Rebuild entire index from scratch
- **File Metadata** - Tracks modified time, size, hash

See [First-Time Setup](../getting-started/first-time-setup.md#incremental-vs-full-reindex) for basics.
